The dataset contains the corruption perception index(CPI) of 180 countries in the world from 2012 to 2021.

The CPI of a country is given as a score on a scale of 100 where 100 means very clean and 0 means highly corrupt. The closer a number is to zero, the more corrupt the country is and the closer a number is to 100, the cleaner the country.

The data is provided by **[Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2021)** and was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cvengr/government-corruption-data-of-180-countries). 

I sought to analyze the CPI of Ghana as a country and Africa as a continent over the ten year period. I have posed some questions that I intend to answer with the data. 

Columns:
* `id`: generated automatically for each row
* `country`:names of countries
* `iso`:abbreviation of country
* `region`:geographic region of country
* `year`:year of record
* `score`:CPI 
* `rank`:rank in the world
* `sources`:number of sources that made up the index
* `standard_error`:standard error of the score
