# Corruption-Perception-Index

The dataset contains the corruption perception index(CPI) of 180 countries in the world from 2012 to 2021.

The CPI of a country is given as a score on a scale of 100 where 100 means very clean and 0 means highly corrupt. The closer a number is to zero, the more corrupt the coutry is and the closer a number is to 100, the cleaner the country.

The data is provided by Transparency International and was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cvengr/government-corruption-data-of-180-countries). 

I sought to analyze the CPI of Ghana as a country and Africa as a continent over the period. I have posed some questions that I intend to answer with the data. I start with Ghana before moving on to Africa.
